# Sushi Order App
## TL;DR 
A web app for groups who want to order _a lot_ of things in an all you can eat sushi restaurant
## Description
A _(really)_ simple web app made in plain HTML and JS to order dishes in a restaurant. This is especially useful if there are 5+ people around the table who may order the very same dish of someone else. This app simply takes a list of `\n` separated dishes IDs (strings) and returns a list of each item and its quantity. Any lowercase character is automatically converted to its uppercase equivalent

The idea for this app came to my mind when I went to an all you can eat sushi restaurant in Mazzano (Brescia, Italy) with 7 friends of mine. We had to write numbers on a small piece of paper that was sent to the kitchen and we had to know the quantity of each dish before writing it down. This seemed simple ("let's raise our hands", said Roberto) but it turned out to be really chaotic, mostly because some of us were so _mona_ and were not listening. This led to some creative _bestemmie_, but that's not the point

Next time my friends (one at time) will simply read their numbers and I'll write them down on a digital note. Then I'll use that note as an input to my app and guess what? No more _bestemmie_ (the fun part is over ðŸ˜”)
